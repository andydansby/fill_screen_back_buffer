# fill_screen_back_buffer

This is a test project for copying an image from a back buffer to the ZX Spectrum screen

I'm expermenting various ways to fill the screen from the back buffer

Back buffer image is layed out linerally
However the ZX Spectrum has a different method for laying out the screen that is more character friendly




in SevenuP ZX Spectrum screen program
image must be 224 pixels wide and 192 pixels tall
data outputted
gfx
byte sort priority
x char
char line
y char
mask
frame

interleave line
